# Engineering log

How the synthetic match engine was built, debugged and tuned, and why. Append to this file as the project goes on:
every non-trivial change gets an entry (what we saw, what we guessed, what the measurement said, what fixed it).

## Method

The engine has to produce data a football fan or analyst would accept as real. "Looks plausible" is not testable, so the
loop is always the same:

1. **Targets.** Write down rough real-football norms as bands (goals 2.4-3.1, pass accuracy 0.78-0.88, ball in play 55-68%,
   ...). They are tuning targets from memory, not redistributed data, and they live in `scripts/calibrate.py` and
   `scripts/realism.py`. When a norm is uncertain, say so and keep the band wide.
2. **Measure, do not eyeball.** Simulate many matches in parallel and compare means with the bands. One match proves
   nothing; 24-48 matches give usable means (goal count noise is about +/-0.3).
3. **Decompose before changing anything.** When a number is off, split it until the cause is visible, using throwaway
   scripts (scratchpad, not committed unless reusable): decisions by pitch third, shot sources by kind and by role, pass
   outcomes by estimated vs actual success, spell lengths, receiver position relative to the offside line.
4. **Fix the root cause, then re-measure.** Changing the symptom's own knob usually just moves the problem (see the
   shot-volume story below). Prefer the change that makes behaviour more football-like over the one that hits the number.
5. **One tuning table.** Behaviour coefficients live in `engine.TUNE`; role and phase tables live in `movement.py`.
   Sweeps can override TUNE from the command line (`calibrate.py key=value`).
6. **Let a search balance the table, not a human.** Parameters interact (more forward passing means more shots means more
   goals), so after structural fixes `scripts/tune.py` does a coordinate search on common random numbers (same seeds for
   every candidate) and minimises the distance outside all bands at once. Structural gaps (missing behaviour) cannot be
   tuned away: if a metric will not move, the model lacks something.
7. **Keep tests and determinism.** `tests/test_sim.py` checks the same seed gives the same match and basic invariants.
8. **Commit every iteration** with the measured effect in the message.

Rules learned the hard way:
- Do not edit sim files while a tuner run is going: its workers re-import them on every evaluation.
- Never run multiprocessing from `python - <<EOF` on Windows (spawn re-imports `__main__`; it forks a runaway storm).
  Put the script in a file.
- Check how many cores the machine has before choosing worker counts (24 here; we ran 6 for a day).
- Parameter bounds must not allow impossible values (a pass-error scale went negative at a low tuned value).
- A metric that only counts a label (pressure events) can hide a real behavioural mismatch: investigate it.

## Design decisions (and why)

- **Engine style**: event-driven on-ball decisions over real geometry plus 5 Hz kinematic movement, not a full
  per-tick agent simulation (too much behaviour to tune) and not pure random events (no space, no xG, no tracking).
  Researched: SoccER (synthetic tracking + events from a game engine), FootballEngine (40 Hz F# 2D), minute-by-minute
  zone simulators, Google Research Football. Borrowed ideas only; no code.
- **Two output streams**: ground-truth events and tracking frames, like a real provider.
- **Explanation ground truth**: each decision records the options considered and why one won (`why`), so the explain
  and fact-check agents can cite real causes.

## Case studies

### Shots: 150 per match (target 25)
Hypothesis 1: shot utility too high. Raising the shot cost barely helped. Decision profile by pitch third showed carriers
*carrying* into the box instead of passing (take-ons were free). Added an explicit take-on duel and cheaper passing risk.
Still too many. Shot-source breakdown showed the quality distribution (distance, xG) was realistic but the *number of
box entries* was 4x real: defenders collapsed onto their goal line (the whole block followed the ball with no depth
floor) and nobody blocked the shot line. Fixes: minimum depth per role, and three "cover" defenders who drop onto the
ball-goal line when the ball is near their goal. Goals/shots then came into band.

### Pass completion that did not match its own estimate
Chosen passes had an estimated success of 0.82 but 0.60-0.70 happened in the 0.7-0.85 bucket. Logging where interceptions
occurred showed most "interceptions" were losses of passes that arrived loose: the receiver went to the *aimed* point
while the ball flew to the point with execution error, so a nearby marker won it. The receiver now tracks the real ball
flight and can stretch further. Completion went 0.59 to 0.86 with no other change. Lesson: compare estimate vs actual
before touching probabilities.

### Pressing and interceptions looked fine but were not
Pressure events were 780 per match (real about 300) and passes per defensive action 7 (real 9-12): defenders hounded
the carrier. Pressing radius, number of pressers and the commit rate were reduced; pass-block events were split from
true interceptions (a defender next to the passer blocks, he does not read the pass).

### Offsides (0.1 per match, real about 4-5)
Receivers were 10-30 m behind the defensive line at pass time. Forwards now hover around the last defender with a
slow oscillation, runs end around the line, and the passer perceives the line with a 0.8 s lag so mistimed runs are
flagged. Measured the ceiling first (ignore the offside check entirely: about 2 per match) to prove the positioning
was the limit, not the passer's awareness.

### Running volume by position
Everyone ran about the same, and strikers ran the most. Role energy table (`movement.CRUISE`) now gives central
midfielders about 12 km, centre-backs 9, strikers 10, keepers 4; `scripts/run_by_role.py` guards it.

### Traits had no effect (playmaker)
`scripts/trait_effect.py` compares players with a trait to same-role players without it. Playmaker showed no change in
progressive passes until the progression multiplier was raised.

### xG scale
Typical shots had xG about 0.2 (real 0.1): the logistic intercept was too generous. Re-scaled (and shot utility with it)
so mean xG per shot is about 0.1 and headers about 0.07.

## Tuning runs (`scripts/tune.py`, score = sum of distances outside bands / band width; 0 is perfect)

| run | matches per eval | start | end | notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 24 | 5.78 | 2.98 | after passing-style rewrite; goals/shots/crosses balanced |
| 2 | 24 | 8.17 | 3.90 | stricter metrics added (role shot shares, passes per possession) |
| 3 | 24 | 3.74 | 2.67 | after accuracy and shot-share parameters; 14 parameters, 1 round |
| 4 | 40 | 2.75 | 2.29 | 20 workers, stopped after round 0 (diminishing returns). Validated on 96 fresh matches: goals 3.04, shots 24.6, xG 3.08, offsides 6.1; still off: pass accuracy 0.76, throw-ins 27, open-play crosses 11.6, aerial duels 41.5, striker shot share 0.53 |

### Completeness over decimals (decision)
After the aggregates were in band we stopped chasing them and added what a real feed contains, even where numbers are
slightly off: keeper actions (catch / parry / tip over, throws and kicks, claims, punches, sweeps, outfield keeper),
free kicks with takers and walls, corner routines (short, near/far post, penalty spot, edge of box), throw-ins tagged
with hands, formation changes (11- and 10-man shapes), VAR for penalties and red cards, advantage play. Each is an event
type or event field in `EVENTS.md`, so downstream agents see the full vocabulary.
Bugs found on the way: two sent-off players with the same slot index were parked at the same point (zero distance in
the separation step gave NaN); fixed with distinct parking spots and a distance floor. A free-kick xG that counted wall
players as open-play blockers made direct free kicks worthless; set balls now use a separate xG with a fixed wall block.

### Speed of the tuning loop
One evaluation is 24-40 full matches at about 10 s each. We used 6 workers on a 24-core machine for a day. Using 20 workers
cut a tuner step from 80 s to 52 s. Next: faster engine hot paths (60 % of time is the movement targets), half-match tuning,
and a surrogate-regression tuner (fit metric ~ parameters from perturbation runs, then gradient descent on the surrogate).

### Engine speed (9.5 s -> 5.8 s per match)
Profile (cProfile, sorted by own time): 60 % in `movement.team_targets`, 22 % in `_steer`; the cost was call overhead on
tiny arrays, not arithmetic. Three changes, none altering behaviour: `np.clip` / `np.linalg.norm` / `np.stack` replaced by
two-ufunc `clip`, an einsum `nrm` and a plain subtraction for the frame flip (same match, 16 % faster); movement
targets recomputed every other tick unless the ball is in flight or loose (players already lag their targets by about
0.25 s; 30 % faster). Calibration unchanged within noise. Further options if needed: numba on `team_targets`.

## Is the tuner machine learning?

No, and it should not be described as such. The behaviour weights in `TUNE` are hand-designed utility terms in a softmax
choice model; `tune.py` is a derivative-free coordinate search (simulation-based calibration) that minimises distance to
real-world bands. Nothing is trained on data (there is none). Honest framing: automated calibration against measurable
norms. Possible genuinely-ML upgrades: Bayesian optimisation with a Gaussian-process surrogate over TUNE, or a learned
emulator of the simulator.

## Open gaps (as of this entry)

Pass accuracy still a little low (0.74 vs 0.78+), pass volume low (about 690 vs 750-950), open-play crosses low (12-22 vs
25+) because crosses created too many header shots (header conversion reduced, retune pending), aerial duels (44 vs 50+),
strikers still take a large share of shots, home advantage and competitive balance need re-measuring after the latest
changes, goalkeeper and free-kick detail, tracking orientation and 25 Hz output.
